## Cardano Message Verification Frontend
We wanted to build a Cardano Message Verification Frontend Frontend as open and inclusive as Cardano. A repository that is in the hands of the Cardano community and can be constantly evolved by it.

For this to be successful, the repository relies on your contributions, and the fact that you are reading this text probably means that you have something to contribute.

## Clone the repo
```console
git clone https://github.com/cardano-foundation/verify-cardano-message-fe.git
```

## Navigate into the folder
```console
cd cardano-signer-verification
```

## Install all dependencies
```console
npm install
```

## Production build

Create at least once a production build (as this pulls missing files)
```console
npm run build
```

## Local development

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
```console
npm run dev
```
